# eth-kickstart

The kickstart contract is an approval system for payout requests. It is inspired by "Kickstarter" and tries to improve upon its shortcomings. Users are able to contribute to a campaign. A manager can then request a payout for that campaign. The payout is only executed if approved by the majority of the contributors.
